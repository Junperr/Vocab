My own app to learn vocabulary

The app is still under development but it can already be used
Steps to use it on your computer: (not the only way)
Frist time :
- Download Anaconda (you can download it there https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads)
- Open anaconda prompt
- enter the following lines : (not the right lines)
	create rep
	activate rep
	conda forge modules
	spyder
- open everything file in you editor 
- execute the file (press f5 by default)
- Create your file to add words (file format described in another file)
- write in the console add_word(path_for_your_file)
- answer each question
- write train(x) with x the number of words you want to train for

Other time:
